# GGGDunlix Github Profile

Hi! I'm an amateur developer who's done a lot of useless things, but some people find them pretty useful. Weird. If you are one of those people, you are in the right place.


## Experience

Not much. I've done a lot of work on FiveM with C# and some work with Java. I have some general knowledge for some other languages, but not much.
